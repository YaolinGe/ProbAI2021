To whom it may concern,

This is Yaolin GE, a 1st year Ph.D. candidate at Department of Mathematical Sciences at NTNU, currently working on MASCOT (Maritime Autonomous Sampling and Statistical Application) project. I have been working on various projects during the past years which are multidisciplinary including but not limited in the fields of statistics, machine learning, deep learning and robotics. So far, I have enjoyed learning by doing philosophy a lot. 


The reason why I am applying for this summer campus training on ProbAI is that it can provide me a sound experience in using practical programming languages such as python on some practical applications. It can thus expand my view to a broader width and help me meet more people who are working with the related fields. 


To conclude, I expect to contribute to the practical researches with my professional knowledge and practical skills obtained from this virtual summer campus program. With full confidence in me as well as the professional training you provide in the program, I believe that my plan will be realized any time soon. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
